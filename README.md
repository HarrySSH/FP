*Final Project Overview*

The final project for this course is designed to provide students with hands-on experience in conducting a machine learning analysis. The project is divided into two major parts: the first involves working on a dataset of the group’s choice, while the second focuses on collaboratively working with all groups on a common dataset. This project will help students grasp the full machine learning workflow—from data acquisition and analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation—to critical assessment of model performance. The project culminates in an individual essay that reflects on the experiences and methodologies utilized in both parts of the assignment. The overall project is worth 100 points, divided as follows: Presentation (30 points), Individual Essay (30 points), and Compensation Dataset (40 points).

**Project Structure**

### Part 1: Group Choice Dataset

Each group will implement machine learning models on two datasets. The first dataset is chosen from the provided resource (https://tdcommons.ai/single_pred_tasks/tox). The goal is to apply a machine learning approach to this dataset, covering all stages from data exploration to model evaluation.

As a group, you need to deliver a presentation. The key elements in the presentation are outlined below. This should also guide you in conducting machine learning research.

#### 1.1 Presentation

**Overall:**
- Each group will present their project as if giving a research talk.
- **Presentation Duration:** 30 minutes (25 minutes for the presentation and 5 minutes for questions).
- **Evaluation Criteria:**
  - Content covering all key aspects of the project: data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and summary.
  - Ability to answer questions effectively during the Q&A session.
  - The group with the best presentation will have an additional 10 minutes to explain how they achieved the best performance.

**Key Contents in the Presentation:**

- **Dataset Selection and Analysis**
  - Select a dataset from the provided source.
  - Perform exploratory data analysis to determine the characteristics of the dataset.
  - Answer questions such as:
    - How many data points are there?
    - What is the proportion like? Are there any data imbalance issues?

- **Feature Engineering**
  - Decide which features will be used for model training.
  - Describe any modifications applied to the features.
  - Provide reasoning for feature selection or modification and discuss the goals behind these decisions.

- **Model Training**
  - Describe how the dataset was split for training, validation, and testing.
  - Choose an appropriate machine learning model.
  - Explain any hyperparameter tuning and optimization performed.
  - Testing multiple machine learning models is highly recommended. It is difficult to justify that you have chosen the best model without comparison.

- **Evaluation**
  - Report the model’s performance using suitable evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).
  - Justify the choice of evaluation metrics based on the problem context.

- **Summary**
  - Reflect on the overall performance of your model.
  - Emphasize the thought process behind model choices, adjustments, and experimental rigor.
  - **Note:** The project will not be graded on absolute model performance; rather, emphasis will be placed on the quality of analysis, justifications, and explanations provided.

#### 1.2 Individual Essay

In the final part of the project, each student will individually write a paper describing the work done in Part 1. Importantly, this part requires the use of a different machine learning method than the one used in the group presentation. The aim is to explore an alternative approach and potentially achieve better results.

**Essay Requirements:**

- **Abstract and Introduction**
  - Provide an overview of the project, including objectives and methodologies used.

- **Method**
  - Describe the method applied, including dataset details and modifications.
  - Discuss the machine learning algorithm used and the rationale behind it.
  - Provide a link to your GitHub repository containing the open-sourced code.

- **Results**
  - Present the performance of your model.
  - Compare it to other models (including hyperparameter tuning) and provide an analysis of why certain methods performed better or worse.

- **Discussion**
  - Address the current limitations of your approach and suggest potential future work to improve performance.

For additional formatting guidelines, please use the following template: https://github.com/chrelli/bioRxiv-word-template.git.

**Notes:**
- All code must be made publicly available on GitHub.
- Each student must ensure that the chosen approach and analysis are distinct from the group presentation to reflect independent effort and understanding.
- We want you to experience writing a paper while keeping it concise; therefore, the essay should be less than 5 pages.

### Part 2: Compensation Dataset (Same for All Groups)

In the second part, all groups will collaboratively work on a shared dataset (details will be provided later). The objective is to achieve the best possible performance on a held-out test set. Each group will be allowed to submit their models multiple times to compete for the highest performance.

**Key Requirements:**

- **Dataset Handling**
  - Divide the dataset as deemed suitable, but ensure that the split strategy is well documented.

- **Performance Improvement**
  - Collaboratively improve the model's performance using a range of techniques, such as model tuning, feature engineering, and validation strategies.
  - Ensure reproducibility of results.
  - Submit model versions to the instructor (Jeff) for evaluation.
  - Jeff will maintain a leaderboard of the top 10 performing models. The group with the best-performing model will receive a prize.

**Point Allocation:**
- **Presentation:** Worth 30 points.
- **Individual Essay:** Worth 30 points.
- **Compensation Dataset (Shared Dataset):** Worth 40 points.
  - **Best Group:** 40 points.
  - **Second Place:** 35 points.
  - **Third Place:** 30 points.
  - The not No.1 group must make at least 5 submissions to qualify for points.

The project is designed to encourage collaborative effort, innovation, and thorough understanding of machine learning concepts. Good luck, and may the best models win!
